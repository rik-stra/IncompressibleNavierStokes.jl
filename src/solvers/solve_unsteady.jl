"""
Solve unsteady problem using `method`.

If `Δt` is a real number, it is rounded such that `(t_end - t_start) / Δt` is
an integer.
If `Δt = nothing`, the time step is chosen every `n_adapt_Δt` iteration with
CFL-number `cfl` .

The `processors` are called after every time step.

Note that the `state` observable passed to the `processor.initialize` function
contains vector living on the device, and you may have to move them back to
the host using `Array(u)` in the processor.

Return `(; u, t), outputs`, where `outputs` is a  named tuple with the
outputs of `processors` with the same field names.
