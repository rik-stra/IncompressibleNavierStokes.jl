# Examples gallery

Here is a gallery of selected commented example simulations.
The outputs are generated with [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)
and displayed inline.
Copy-pasteable code is available at the bottom of each example.
The raw Julia source scripts can be found in the
[examples](https://github.com/agdestein/IncompressibleNavierStokes.jl/tree/main/examples)
folder.
