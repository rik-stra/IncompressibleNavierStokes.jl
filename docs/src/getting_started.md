# Getting Started

To install IncompressibleNavierStokes, open up a Julia-REPL, type `]` to get
into Pkg-mode, and type:

```sh
add IncompressibleNavierStokes
```

which will install the package and all dependencies to your local environment.
Note that IncompressibleNavierStokes requires Julia version `1.9` or above.

Check out the [gallery](examples/index.md) for commented example simulations.
